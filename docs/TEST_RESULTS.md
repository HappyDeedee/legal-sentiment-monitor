# Test Results

This file records verification outcomes. Add new entries at the top.

How to read this file:

- entries are reverse chronological, newest first;
- use the topmost relevant entry for current status;
- older entries are historical snapshots and may mention states that were later
  superseded by newer entries above them;
- use `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/CHANGE_REQUESTS.md`, and
  `docs/TRACEABILITY.md` for final current-state decisions.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 4 Normal User Task Wizard Verified

Environment: local worktree `E:\myproject\MediaCrawler-worktrees\v1-roadmap`
using `uv run`, the monitoring SQLite database, and Node script parsing for the
single-file frontend.

Result:

- Replaced the normal-user task creation experience with a four-step wizard:
  target, collection content, schedule, and report.
- Included law firm, aliases, platform search terms, selected platforms, crawl
  range, comment collection, frequency/send time, enabled state, and recipient
  emails in the normal-user path.
- Added crawl range copy explaining that max items is a content-count cap,
  start page and max pages depend on platform behavior, and task timeout is
  controlled by administrator Runtime Strategy.
- Hid account binding, proxy binding, AI access override, email template
  override, output mode, target type, and browser mode from normal users.
- Added API-side normal-user payload cleanup so advanced task fields are
  ignored even if a normal user submits them directly.
- Kept administrator advanced task settings available and verified that
  administrator submissions still persist advanced bindings.

Verification:

- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py`
- Result: 207 passed, 3 warnings.
- `uv run python scripts/check_docs.py`
- Result: PASS docs consistency.
- Node syntax check for the `api/monitor_web/index.html` script block
- Result: monitor web script parses.

Limitations:

- Phase 4 does not implement Phase 5 account/profile/proxy runtime locking or
  `profile_key` path resolution.
- Phase 4 does not make server-side QR login the primary production login
  flow; that remains Phase 6 after the account environment is complete.
- No server-like acceptance validation was performed in this phase.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 3 Administrator Resource Center Verified

Environment: local worktree `E:\myproject\MediaCrawler-worktrees\v1-roadmap`
using `uv run`, the monitoring SQLite database, and Node script parsing for the
single-file frontend.

Result:

- Refined the administrator resource center UI for platform accounts, proxy
  resources, AI access, mail configuration, and mail templates.
- Kept platform accounts in the existing account-detail dialog with account
  resource metrics, filters, login maintenance, Cookie maintenance, proxy
  binding, bulk actions, and customer-safe login state text.
- Added proxy resource summary cards, search/status filters, and consistent
  modal action footer for create/edit.
- Added AI access summary cards, search/protocol/test-status filters,
  consistent modal action footer for create/edit, and retained the dedicated
  connection-test dialog without exposing raw API keys.
- Changed mail configuration to use edit/test dialogs, summary cards, masked
  password behavior, and a test console that records success or failure without
  blocking report generation.
- Added mail-template summary cards, search/status filters, live preview, and
  consistent modal actions.

Verification:

- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py`
- Result: 206 passed, 3 warnings.
- `uv run python scripts/check_docs.py`
- Result: PASS docs consistency.
- Node syntax check for the `api/monitor_web/index.html` script block
- Result: monitor web script parses.

Limitations:

- Phase 3 is a resource-center UI and interaction refinement. It does not
  implement Phase 4 simplified normal-user task wizard, Phase 5
  profile-key/lock runtime behavior, Phase 6 primary server-side login flow, or
  Phase 8 server-like acceptance validation.
- Proxy connection testing remains outside Phase 3 because the current product
  and API surface only define create/edit/disable/delete for proxy resources;
  no new proxy test requirement was accepted in this phase.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 2 System Settings Center Verified

Environment: local worktree `E:\myproject\MediaCrawler-worktrees\v1-roadmap`
using `uv run`, the monitoring SQLite database, and Node script parsing for the
single-file frontend.

Result:

- Added database-backed runtime settings with defaults, `monitor.yaml` loading,
  database overrides, validation ranges, apply scopes, environment locks, and
  audit logging.
- Added administrator-only `/api/monitor/runtime-settings` read/update APIs and
  a grouped Runtime Strategy page for Crawling, Login, Scheduler, and
  Retention settings.
- Kept Runtime Strategy inaccessible to normal users through both API role
  checks and menu permissions.
- Moved scheduler tick/disable, global crawl concurrency, per-platform
  concurrency, crawler timeout, crawler retry count/delay, QR timeout, login
  session TTL, lock cleanup buffer, and retention settings into the runtime
  settings layer.
- Changed newly started crawl runs to store `timeout_seconds` and
  `deadline_at`, allocate remaining run time to platform crawler attempts, and
  mark deadline-exceeded runs as `timeout` while preserving partial platform
  summaries.
- Updated safe environment examples with the deployment-lock variables for
  Phase 2 runtime settings.

Verification:

- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py`
- Result: 206 passed, 3 warnings.
- `uv run python scripts/check_docs.py`
- Result: PASS docs consistency.
- Node syntax check for the `api/monitor_web/index.html` script block
- Result: monitor web script parses.

Limitations:

- Phase 2 does not implement Phase 3 administrator resource-page refinements,
  Phase 4 simplified normal-user task wizard, Phase 5 persisted
  account/profile/proxy lock acquisition, or Phase 6 primary server-login flow.
- Retention settings are configurable and visible, but automated cleanup jobs
  remain for later operations work.
- No server-like acceptance validation was performed in this phase.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 1 Users And Permissions Verified

Environment: local worktree `E:\myproject\MediaCrawler-worktrees\v1-roadmap`
using `uv run`, the monitoring SQLite database, and Node script parsing for the
single-file frontend.

Result:

- Implemented environment-bootstrap administrator creation and bcrypt password
  hashing.
- Added session-based authentication with HTTP-only `monitor_session` cookie
  and hashed session tokens in `user_sessions`.
- Added `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/session`, and
  administrator-only `/api/users` management endpoints.
- Added shared FastAPI authentication and role dependencies.
- Protected `/api/monitor/*` routes with session authentication.
- Restricted platform accounts, proxies, AI, mail, login sessions, system
  diagnostics, smoke/system checks, and resource operations to administrators.
- Scoped normal-user jobs, runs, reports, and leads to the owning user in the
  default workspace.
- Added frontend login screen, session check, current-user badge, logout, and
  role-based navigation/menu visibility.
- Implemented `scripts/check_docs.py`.

Verification:

- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py`
- Result: 200 passed, 3 warnings.
- `uv run python scripts/check_docs.py`
- Result: PASS docs consistency.
- Node syntax check for the `api/monitor_web/index.html` script block
- Result: monitor web script parses.

Limitations:

- Phase 1 does not implement runtime settings, simplified normal-user task
  wizard, profile-key runtime resolver, server-side QR login primary flow, or
  server-like acceptance validation. These remain for Phase 2 and later phases.
- Local development cookie settings still use `secure=false`; production HTTPS
  cookie behavior remains part of server-like validation and deployment work.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 0.5 Schema Foundation Verified

Environment: local worktree `E:\myproject\MediaCrawler-worktrees\v1-roadmap`
using `uv run` and the monitoring SQLite database.

Result:

- Implemented Phase 0.5 foundation schema in `api/monitoring/database.py`.
- Created `workspaces`, `users`, `user_sessions`, `system_settings`,
  `audit_logs`, and `resource_locks`.
- Added `workspace_id`, `created_by`, and `updated_by` to priority business
  tables.
- Added `profile_key` to `social_accounts` and `login_sessions`, including
  default key backfill and inheritance for new account login sessions.
- Added run timeout fields to `crawl_runs`: `timeout_seconds`, `deadline_at`,
  and `timeout_reason`.
- Added account/profile lock fields to `social_accounts`:
  `locked_by_run_id`, `locked_at`, and `lock_expires_at`.
- Verified default workspace backfill with `workspace_id = 1`.
- Verified existing MVP tasks, social accounts, login sessions, runs, and
  reports still load after migration.

Verification:

- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py`
- Result: 198 passed, 3 warnings.

Limitations:

- Phase 0.5 adds schema and minimal profile-key persistence only. Full
  authentication, RBAC, runtime settings UI, runtime lock acquisition,
  timeout enforcement, and server-like login validation remain for later
  phases.
- No server-like acceptance validation was performed in this phase.

## 2026-06-14 - Documentation Review Follow-Up For Timeout And Range

Environment: local repository documentation update.

Result:

- Added a concrete run-level timeout example showing remaining-time allocation

- Added YAML-to-database runtime settings mapping.

Limitations:

- No code or runtime validation was performed.
- The review item claiming CR-012A/B/C were missing from `TRACEABILITY.md` was
  not applied because the current matrix already contains separate accepted
  CR-012A, CR-012B, and CR-012C rows.
