# Current State

Last updated: 2026-06-14

## Current Phase

Phase 0 documentation is complete. Phase 0.5 - Schema Foundation is complete
and verified. Phase 1 - Users And Permissions is complete and verified. Phase
2 - System Settings Center is complete and verified. Phase 3 - Administrator
Resource Center is complete and verified. Phase 4 - Normal User Task Wizard is
complete and verified. Phase 5 - Account Environment is complete and verified.
Phase 6 - Server Login Flow is complete and verified locally. Phase 7 - Runs,
Reports, And AI is complete and verified locally.
The active SQLite schema now provides the foundation tables and columns
required before later implementation work, and the web/API layer now has
session login, administrator/normal-user roles, menu visibility,
owner-scoped business data access, administrator-managed runtime strategy
settings, administrator resource pages with consistent summary, toolbar, modal,
and test interactions, a normal-user task wizard with administrator-only
advanced options, and profile-key based account environments with persisted
account/profile/proxy locks, stale-run recovery, server-side QR login as the
primary administrator flow, structured login states, profile persistence/reuse
checks, deployment gating for local-window login fallback, AI/manual-review
fallback, email-failure-tolerant report generation, report-specific lead
preview switching, and run log refresh/copy/download controls.

## Implementation Status

- Phase 0 - Documentation: complete.
- Phase 0.5 - Schema Foundation: complete and verified.
- Phase 1 - Users And Permissions: complete and verified.
- Phase 2 - System Settings: complete and verified.
- Phase 3 - Administrator Resource Center: complete and verified.
- Phase 4 - Normal User Task Wizard: complete and verified.

Phase 8 can begin next. Phase 9 implementation must still proceed in order
and must not bypass unfinished earlier phases.

## Completed

- Project direction has been clarified as a server-deployed ToB law-firm
  public-opinion monitoring system.
- The first-version boundary has been clarified as single-server,
  low-concurrency, administrator-managed resources, and normal-user task
  creation.
- The role split has been clarified:
  - system administrator maintains account pool, proxies, AI, email, templates,
    runtime strategy, and users;
  - normal user configures platforms, content, frequency, and recipient emails.
- The account-environment model has been clarified:
  task -> platform account -> profile -> proxy -> server browser.
- Server-like validation has been made mandatory for production acceptance.
- Initial governance documents have been added.
- Menu-level product requirements have been documented.
- Change request intake, traceability, and agent workflow documents have been
  added.
- A confirmation gate has been added: ambiguous high-impact requirements must
  be confirmed by the user before becoming accepted product or architecture
  decisions.
- P0 implementation specifications for roles, account environment, runtime
  settings, and data model have been added as planning documents.
- A permission confirmation pack, compatible schema migration plan, and runtime
  configuration example have been added.
- API authentication/authorization and server deployment guides have been
  added.
- Documentation consistency check specification and Phase 0.5 test coverage
  have been added.
- Permission, workspace, authentication, initial administrator, disabled-user
  behavior, audit-log timing, and runtime settings storage decisions have been
  accepted using the V1 recommended options.
- Phase 0.5 schema foundation has been implemented in
  `api/monitoring/database.py`: default workspace, user/session/settings/audit
  tables, ownership columns, profile keys, run timeout fields, account lock
  fields, and proxy `resource_locks`.
- Existing monitoring MVP task/account/login/run/report records still load
  after the schema foundation migration.
- Phase 1 user and permission foundation has been implemented:
  environment-bootstrap administrator creation, bcrypt password hashes,
  session-token cookies backed by `user_sessions`, user management APIs,
  shared FastAPI auth/role dependencies, administrator-only resource APIs,
  normal-user owner scope for jobs/runs/reports/leads, and frontend login/menu
  visibility.
- `scripts/check_docs.py` has been implemented and currently passes.
- Phase 2 runtime strategy has been implemented:
  `api/monitoring/settings.py` defines runtime defaults, YAML mapping,
  validation ranges, apply scopes, and environment locks; `system_settings`
  stores database overrides with audit logging; administrators can edit grouped
  Runtime Strategy tables; normal users cannot access runtime settings APIs;
  scheduler tick/disable, crawl concurrency, crawler retry, run-level timeout,
  QR timeout, login session TTL, lock cleanup buffer, and retention settings
  now read through the runtime settings layer.
- Newly started crawl runs copy `crawler_timeout_seconds` into
  `crawl_runs.timeout_seconds`, compute `deadline_at`, allocate remaining run
  time to platform crawler attempts, and mark deadline-exceeded runs as
  `timeout` while preserving partial platform results.
- Phase 3 administrator resource center has been refined:
  platform accounts keep the single account-detail dialog, proxy resources have
  summary cards plus search/status filters, AI access has summary cards plus
  protocol/test-status filters and a connection-test dialog, mail configuration
  uses edit/test dialogs with masked password behavior, and mail templates have
  summary cards plus search/status filters and live preview.
- Phase 4 normal-user task creation has been simplified:
  normal users see a four-step task wizard for target, collection content,
  schedule, and report recipients; crawl range copy explains the actual V1
  boundaries; account/proxy/AI/template/browser fields are hidden from normal
  users; the API also clears those advanced fields for normal-user create/edit
  requests; administrators still keep advanced task binding controls.
- Phase 5 account environment runtime has been implemented:
  account profile runtime paths are derived from stable `profile_key` values,
  new account environments ignore arbitrary customer-provided profile paths,
  account names are display labels only, account/profile summaries no longer
  expose real server paths, account/profile locks use inline
  `social_accounts` fields, proxy concurrency uses `resource_locks`, run
  cleanup releases locks, and startup/scheduler recovery reconciles timed-out
  running runs before releasing persisted locks.
- Phase 6 server login flow has been implemented:
  administrator account login now starts from server-side QR sessions by
  default, login APIs and the frontend use structured states (`preparing`,
  `waiting_qrcode`, `waiting_scan`, `waiting_confirm`, `success`,
  `needs_verification`, `qrcode_failed`, `timeout`, and `platform_error`),
  legacy login states are normalized for compatibility, successful login is
  re-checked before the account is marked active, profile-key paths are reused
  after the browser session closes, and `MONITOR_ALLOW_LOCAL_LOGIN_WINDOW=false`
  hides and blocks local-window login fallback for production mode.
- Phase 7 runs, reports, and AI behavior has been verified:
  jobs can complete with AI disabled and email unavailable, new contents enter
  `pending_review` instead of blocking report generation, report wording keeps
  "suspected negative leads" semantics and avoids factual conclusions, report
  preview requests load leads scoped to the selected report ID, and run logs
  expose refresh, copy, and download controls with customer-safe text.

## In Progress

- Phase 8 - Server-Like Validation is ready to start.

## Known Risks

- Phase 5 still stores `profile_path` as a transition-only internal runtime
  field for existing login/crawler code paths, but new identity and path
  resolution are `profile_key` based and customer-facing responses mask real
  paths.
- Current system is closer to a single-team MVP than a production multi-user
  system.
- Server-side QR login and profile persistence have local automated coverage,
  but still need container/server validation before production acceptance.
- The newly added product documents are initial versions and should be refined
  during implementation.
- Profile migration strategy has been clarified: existing low-volume
  `profile_path` accounts do not need long-term compatibility and can be reset
  or re-logged in under the new `profile_key` model.
- Phase 2 retention settings are configurable and stored, but automated
  retention cleanup jobs remain for later operations work.
- Production acceptance still requires Phase 8 server-like validation with no
  dependency on the operator's local Chrome.
- Phase 7 has local automated coverage but does not prove real AI provider,
  SMTP, or platform behavior in a server-like environment; those remain
  deployment and pilot risks.

## Next Step

Implement Phase 8 in small increments:

1. add or confirm a container/server-like deployment path;
2. verify web-only login in the server-like environment;
3. verify profile persistence across service restart;
4. verify multiple same-platform accounts use separate profiles;
5. verify account/profile/proxy concurrency limits;
6. verify no local Chrome is required for acceptance;
7. record results in `TEST_RESULTS.md` without marking Phase 9 complete.

## Latest Verification

Phase 7 local verification passed on 2026-06-14:

- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py`
- Result: 213 passed, 3 warnings.
- `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_mvp.py -k "phase_7 or pending_review or report_scope or monitor_page_uses_tob"`
- Result: 4 passed, 209 deselected, 1 warning.
- `uv run python scripts/check_docs.py`
- Result: PASS docs consistency.
- Node syntax check for `api/monitor_web/index.html` script block
- Result: monitor web script parses.

No server-like acceptance run has been completed for the new plan yet.
